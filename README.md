 250MHz Differential Oscilloscope Probe

Originally made by Mark Harris of Altium in the YouTube video ["How to Make a DIY Differential Oscilloscope Probe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQDLY-ot4eo), I wanted to adapt the board to use with my Keysight EDUX1052A oscilloscope to use in the 600 V to 800 V range and 50 MHz to 100 MHz range.

Other planned changes to the probe as made by Mark Harris are:
<ol>
 <li>Switchable power supply/battery power</li>
 <li>Adjustable Attenuation</li>
 <li>Overrange LED and buzzer</li>
 <li>BNC or other connector for input</li>
 <li>Better EMI shielding</li>
 <li>3D printed case</li>
</ol>
